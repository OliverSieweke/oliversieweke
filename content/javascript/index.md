#Welcome to Oli's JavaScript Notes !

I've been taking and improving my JavaScrip notes since I started learning the language in 2017. The notes have grown and reached a point where they could be useful to others, drawing together information that is not always that easily found. So I thought I would share them here.

The notes are not meant as tutorials or discussion pages and there is no linear progression - this is more akin to my personal <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDN</a>. They won't be to everyone's taste but if you're wired like me, or if you are looking for details on a specific topic, you might find them useful.

`[Note: My notes are receiving a little clean-up and will get added gradually in the next couple of weeks]`
