    "review": "This is my absolutely favorite JavaScript book - short, precise and extremely well explained. Worth reading multiple times! It really made things click in my head and helped me to develop the right mental models around objects and prototypes. Although it comes from the pre-ES6 era, it is still very relevant and equips with a firm foundation for understanding the internals of ES6 classes."
