Octopus is a crypto trading bot I created for fun in 2018. It is managing my initial investment of 50€ on <a href="https://pro.coinbase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coinbase</a>.

## Backstory

A couple of years ago I made an extremely lucky investment in <a href="https://ethereum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ether</a>, which allowed me to buy a [VW T3 van](/vw-t3.jpg) with my girlfriend. A very instructive journey in terms of trading, psychology and finance!

I had some spare time in 2018 and wanted to get practice in interacting with external APIs. I still had a <a href="https://pro.coinbase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coinbase</a> account and they have a very friendly <a href="https://developers.coinbase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API documentation</a>, so this seemed like an interesting challenge.

Octopus has been trading ever since...

A friend thought this was fun too and threw in 50€. If Octopus is successful we'll go on holiday!

**Note**: I'm working on a little page to visualize the trading history and check how the bot is doing...
