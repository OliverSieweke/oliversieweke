Octopus is a crypto trading bot I created for fun in 2018. It is managing my initial investment of 50€ on Coinbase.

## Backstory
Back in 2016 I made an extremely lucky investment in Ether, which allowed me to buy a VW T3 with my girlfriend. A very instructive journey in terms of trading, psychology and finance!

I had some spare time in 2018 and wanted to get practice in interacting with external APIs. I still had a Coinbase account and they had a very friendly [API documentation](https://developers.coinbase.com/), so this seemed to be an interesting challenge.

Octopus has been trading ever since...

A friend thought this was fun too and threw in 50€. If Octopus is successful we'll go on holiday!

**Note**: I'm working on a little page to visualize the trading history and check how the bot is doing...
