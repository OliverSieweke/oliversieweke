Dragoon is a program I wrote for my [theater friends](https://theaterimnu.de/) to automatise their subtitle creation. They are performing french plays in Berlin and were spending an incredible time tediously copy-pasting and formatting translations into a powerpoint files.

Dragoon is a configurable subtitle builder that does it all in a matter of seconds. You can check it out and upload your files to be transformed. 

It can even take several translations and synchronize them.


A lot of thought went into how to best split up the text.

The code is quite simple and straight forward now, but it required a lot of iterations to simplify it down to what it is now
