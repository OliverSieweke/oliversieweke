The main motivation behind this website was to share my <a href="/projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">projects</a> and <a href="/javascript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JavaScript notes</a> notes. I also quite liked the idea to have a little place on the web where I would be able to publish stuff whenever I want.
