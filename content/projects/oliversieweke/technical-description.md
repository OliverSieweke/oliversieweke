The website was built using <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gatsby</a> and is hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netlify</a>. Some minor complications apart, this was a very smooth developing experience, which also allowed me to play around with <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React hooks</a>, <a href="https://www.graphql.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraphQL</a> and <a href="https://www.styled-components.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Styled Components</a>.
