Memory-Box is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spaced repetition</a> application that provides an interface and algorithm for users to learn and share flashcards efficiently.

Users may create boxes in which they store flashcards with several sides (possibly including multimedia content). They can then test their knowledge and the app will make them repeat those cards they know least more frequently, thus optimizing the learning time.
